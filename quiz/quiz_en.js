My wife loves to solve quizzes. So I wrote an addon for the Peekobot so that the Peekobot can ask a quiz.

Usage: 
‚Ä¢ Include the script with <script src="quiz_en.js"></script> in the index.html, before peekobot.js.
‚Ä¢ Connect the quiz in conversations.js with the node "quiz_intro".
‚Ä¢ fill out "your_exit_node" (see the variable below). Which this node you can connect the exiting of the script with your current conversation flow (for example to go back to the main menu)
‚Ä¢ Look at the sample questions. This way you can add as many questions as you like.

The questions are shuffled, the answers are shuffled. A highscore is counted (by setting a cookie). At the end there is the possibility to display the highscore.

Have fun with the script!
